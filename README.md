# About the project:

I created this project while studying the course React: writing with TypeScript from the company Alura

The application consists of adding a new study topic and setting a time to complete it.
<br>
Once you select a task, the Timer will show the remaining time that you have to complete the task.
<br>
When you click on Start, it will decrease until it reaches "00:00" and the task will be automatically finished
